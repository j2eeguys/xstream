  <body>

    <h2 id="policy">Policy</h2>
    
    <p>Please, before opening a new issue look through the open or resolved ones, you may already find your problem. Also do not
    use the system to ask questions, for that purpose we have a <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing list</a>. We read the list continuously.
    If you are unsure whether the problem is caused by a bug or your usage of XStream, use the user's list first. If we can confirm a bug,
    you may still open an issue. Also do not report on the list that you have created a new issue, we are already notified by the system.</p>
    
    <p>If you like to contribute code, we prefer a patch/diff in contrast to the complete modified file - unless the file itself is new. Please
    provide also unit tests, XStream has a high test coverage and we like to keep this. Additionally, if you provide new files, please also add
    a header with the copyright. It must be a BSD license, simply take the header of any other file in the distribution as template. Otherwise
    we might not be able to add any code of you.</p>
    
    <p>XStream tracks and manages its issues <a href="https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues">issues</a>
    with GitHub's integrated issue management.</p>

    <h2 id="old-issues">Old Issues</h2>

    <p>XStream was hosted for more than a decade at Codehaus and used Codehaus' installation of JIRA as issue management. With the help of
    Paul Hammant's <a href="https://github.com/paul-hammant/JIRA_exporter">export script</a> we can still provide a static version of all the
    <a href="jira/">former issues</a>.</p>
